# Raiyaxi-Lang

<div align="center"><h2>
My own programming language based on Java and with a "compiler made" in Rust<br/><br/>Made by Raiyaxi Ziaoi
</h2></div>
<br/>
Compile the main.rs file and then run from the terminal:<br/><br/>
<i>main.exe hello.ryx -a STD.STD</i><br/><br/>
This will compile and run the included "hello.ryx" file. It will also compile into a .jar file.
<br/><br/>

Raiyaxi-Lang provides a more concise syntax compared to Java but is still usable by Java developers. Think of it like C++ to C. The compiler can be freely edited and optimised by the user.

In future updates I hope that Raiyaxi-Lang will be a functional and object-oriented language with a focus on scientific computing.
