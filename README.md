My own programming language based on Java and with a transpiler made in Rust<br/><br/>Made by Raiyaxi Ziaoi
</h2></div>
<br/>
You must have the JVM and the Rust compiler installed.
<br/>
<br/>
Compile the raiyaxic.rs file and then run from the terminal:<br/><br/>
Windows:<br/>
<i>raiyaxic.exe -h</i><br/>
<br/>Linux:<br/>
<i>./raiyaxic -h</i><br/><br/>
This will display a help screen. Then follow the instructions to transpile the "examples/hello.lsmx" file.
<br/><br/>

Lissomix provides a more concise syntax compared to Java but is still usable by Java developers. Think of it like Kotlin to Java. The compiler can be freely edited and optimised by the user.
<br/><br/>
In future updates I hope that Raiyaxi will be a functional and object-oriented language with a focus on scientific computing.
